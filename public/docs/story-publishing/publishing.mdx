To make sure that the translated stories meet certain quality criteria,
stories need to be reviewed first before being published.

Stories are generally published in full sets of 4.

When you have finished working on a story, you can click the "👍" icon to approve it and change the status to "🗨 feedback".

You can now ask your team mates on discord to review the story and give their approval.

When one or more people have checked the story and also gave their approval "👍" the status changes to "✅ finished".

When one complete set is finished it will switch to "📢 published".

<Info>If this is the first set of your language to be published,
the chances are high that the course itself is not set to public yet. Talk to
a moderator on Discord to publish your course.</Info>

### Criteria for Approval
When you approve a story be sure to check the content carefully.

- Are all the sentences translated into the target language?
- Do the sentences have proper punctuations? E.g. end with a period `.`
- Do all words (except names) have translation hints?
- Does the story have audio? (Only if the language has audio available)
- If the course does not have audio: Are all ARRANGE exercises converted to POINT_TO_PHRASE and SELECT_PHRASE to CONTINUATION? (see [Publish without Audio](https://duostories.org/docs/story-publishing/without_tts))

<Info>This is not a "Like" as you would give it on social media but a signature
      that you certify that the story is ready to be published.</Info>

### Need a set of stories reviewed?
If you are a solo contributor for a course, or none of your teammates are available, and you have a full set of stories ready for review, create a post for your language, and others can volunteer to help out!

Go to the [`#review-request`](https://discord.com/channels/726701782075572277/1114267302825824368) channel.

Please title your post with the names of the languages, so folks can find languages they are familiar with! It is also helpful if you include a link to your course in the Editor. You are welcome to collaborate on review and editing in your forum post here, if you don't have a language-specific contrib channel.

### Publish a "Intro/Welcome" story
As welcome stories (see [Intro and welcome stories](https://duostories.org/docs/story-creation/import#intro-and-welcome-stories)) are not part
of a complete set, they need to be approved by a Moderator. Please contact a Moderator on Discord once your
"Intro/Welcome" story has at least two approvals 👍.
