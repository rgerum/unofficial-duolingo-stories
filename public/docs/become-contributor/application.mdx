If you would like to contribute by translating stories into other languages:

### Requirements
To contribute stories, you must:

- Be a native speaker of the language,
- Have native-level proficiency in the language, or
- Have a native-speaker "partner" who can revise your work.

<Info> If you plan on working with a native-speaker partner, it is best to have that native speaker join this server and submit an application as well, so that you both can be given access to the Editor.</Info>


The only exceptions are for those languages that have no (or very few) native speakers including dead languages, nearly-extinct languages, and conlangs.

Please, only apply to be a contributor if you’re willing to translate at least one Set of (4) Stories.

    If you are applying to translate stories into a dialect, regionally-specific language, conlang, or auxlang -- please see our policies related to those, and include in your application any information about the language you would like us to consider.


### Application Process

- Create an account on Duostories.org https://www.duostories.org/, if you don't already have one. This account will be used for accessing the Editor and Stories.
- On your profile page https://www.duostories.org/profile, link your Duostories account to this Discord account.
- Write a post in ⁠contributor-applications with the following [you will have access to the channel once you read the directions]:
    1. In English, tell us which language you would like to translate into (e.g. "I would like to translate into Russian …") and from (e.g. "… for speakers of Spanish").
    2. In English, provide your Duostories.org account name.
    3. Write us an application message in the language you want to translate into (e.g. if you want to create Russian stories, write your application message in Russian). Show off your skills! Tell us about your background, your language experience and qualifications, your interests, and anything else you like. Just be sure to demonstrate native-level proficiency in your language. (If you're not a native speaker, be sure to have your native-speaker partner revise this before sending.)
- Project admins, current Story contributors, and native speakers will review your application. If you're able to demonstrate native-level proficiency in your language and your language is currently technically possible, you will be given access to the Story Editor and further instructions.
