# Agent Notes

## Formatting
- Run `pnpm run format` after code edits in this repository.
- Use `pnpm run format:check` for CI/local validation.
- Formatting scope is intentionally limited to `src/` and `convex/`.
- Prettier excludes lockfiles and Convex generated files via `.prettierignore`.

## Convex
- Follow `./convex/convex_rules.md` when making changes in `convex/`.
